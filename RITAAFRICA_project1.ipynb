    "#### The purpose of the Customer Management System was to analyze customer feedback to determine how customer experience is affected. The analysis examined feedback to gauge customer experience by tracking how often the term “service” appeared in reviews. Each entry was processed using a for loop to identify mentions of “service,” and the data was stored in a DataFrame for further analysis. This approach provided insight into how customers perceive and express their experiences with the service they received.\n",
    "#### Out of the five feedback entries, “service” was mentioned in all of them. Only one entry described the experience as “great service,” while three out of the five entries reflected \"poor service\". \n",
    "#### The results indicate that “service” is a key area of focus in customer feedback, with both positive and negative mentions. This suggests that customers place significant value on service quality in shaping their overall experience.\n",
    "#### It is recommended to implement service training programs to improve consistency. Additionally, gathering more specific feedback on customer service touchpoints could provide deeper insights into areas for improvement."
